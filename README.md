## Task Overview

<em><strong>Task 1</strong></em>: Permutations and Combinations
Problem: Evaluate the probability of selecting six correct cups in an altered Lady Tasting Tea experiment with and without allowing one or two errors.

<em><strong>Task 2</strong></em>: Assessing Normal Distribution
Generate random values from a normal distribution.
Validate the distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
Visualize results with histograms and probability density functions.

<em><strong>Task 3</strong></em>: t-Test Calculation
Compare pre- and post-exercise heart rates using t-tests to assess the effect of a two-week exercise program.

<em><strong>Task 4</strong></em>: ANOVA and Type II Error Estimation
Simulate and estimate the probability of committing a Type II error when performing one-way ANOVA on three samples.


## Project Overview

The project uses the PlantGrowth dataset, which contains measurements of plant weights across three groups:
* <code>ctrl</code>: Control group.
* <code>trt1</code>: Treatment group 1.
* <code>trt2</code>: Treatment group 2.
    * Perform t-tests to assess differences between groups.
    * Use ANOVA to evaluate differences across all groups.
    * Describe t-tests and their assumptions.
    * Generate meaningful plots to visualize the dataset and results.
